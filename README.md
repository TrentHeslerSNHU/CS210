# CS210 - PROJECT TWO

  ### - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This task for this project was to create an investment learning app for a bank. I was tasked with creating a simple object-oriented program that taught users about the benefits of monthly payments on investment accounts with compounding interest.

  ### - What did you do particularly well?
  I feel that I made clean, compact code. I tried to make things as simple and lightweight as possible, while also avoiding duplicate code. I think I accomplished these aims reasonably well.

  ### - Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I think that perhaps I could have gone a bit more in-depth with my documentation, so that it would be easier for someone to adapt the program for their own purposes. I also toyed with the idea of using pointers to create and delete class objects on the fly, but ultimately abandoned the idea as I didn't feel it was really necessary for the purposes of this project.

  ### - Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The design and implementation of this program were actually pretty simple and straightforward for me. The only issue I really ran into with this program was that I kept getting a compile error in visual studio without any helpful error messages to guide me in remedying it. I eventually realized that the error was the result of my class objects having uninitialized variables upon construction. I simply had to create constructor functions that initialized all of the member variables and then everything worked as it should.

  ### - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think working with classes and, particularly, derived classes will be extremely useful in other projects, course work, and beyond. Most professionally-developed programs are object oriented and knowing how to create and modify objects is crucial to working with a team to develop them. Most often, a programmer or team will work on one particular aspect of the overall program, while other programmers or teams will create the other pieces.

  ### - How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I tried to include helpful comments at regular intervals and keep my code as streamlined and simple as I could. Comments obviously give other programmers an idea of what the program is doing and how. The simplicity obviously makes things, well, simple. Keeping things simple is essential to having adaptable, maintainable code.
